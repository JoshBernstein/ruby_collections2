# Copy the following data into a Ruby file:

ballots = [{1 => 'Smudge', 2 => 'Tigger', 3 => 'Simba'},
           {1 => 'Bella', 2 => 'Lucky', 3 => 'Tigger'},
           {1 => 'Bella', 2 => 'Boots', 3 => 'Smudge'},
           {1 =>'Boots', 2 => 'Felix', 3 => 'Bella'},
           {1 => 'Lucky', 2 => 'Felix', 3 => 'Bella'},
           {1 => 'Smudge', 2 => 'Simba', 3 => 'Felix'}]
           
# Each hash represents a voting ballot, with three names in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. A first place vote is worth 3 points, a 2nd place vote is worth 2 points, and a 3rd place vote is worth 1 point.

# For example, the first ballot {1 => 'Smudge', 2 => 'Tigger', 3 => 'Simba'} shows that this voter chose Smudge for first place, Tigger for 2nd, and Simba for 3rd. Smudge would be awarded 3 points, Tigger would be awarded 2 points, and Simba would be awarded 1 point.

# Create a new hash (scoring) to store candidate => sum of votes
scoring = {}
scoring.default = 0
# loop through each ballot, 
ballots.each do |ballot|
#   set ballot[1] += 3
    scoring[ballot[1]] += 3
#   set ballot[2] += 2
    scoring[ballot[2]] += 2
#   set ballot[1] += 1
    scoring[ballot[3]] += 1
end
